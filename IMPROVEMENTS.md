- Performance concerns with 3D transforms

#### After:
- Reduced to 533 lines (36% reduction)

- Reduced complexity

---

### 4. **Accessibility Improvements** ✅

#### Implemented:
- Added ARIA landmarks (`role="main"`, `role="region"`)
- Added `aria-label` attributes to all interactive elements
- Wrapped book cards in `<article>` tags for semantic structure
- Added `aria-pressed` for toggle buttons
- Added `aria-live` for loading states
- Implemented proper focus states

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Home.jsx`
- `src/components/SearchResults.jsx`
- `src/components/BookDetail.css`

**Benefits:**
- Better screen reader support
- Improved keyboard navigation
- WCAG compliance
- Better user experience for all users

---

### 5. **Component Improvements** ✅

#### Home.jsx
- Integrated with bookService
- Added error handling
- Improved loading states
- Added ARIA landmarks
- Better semantic HTML

#### SearchResults.jsx
- Integrated with bookService
- Dynamic category loading

## 🔄 Migration Path for Real API

The new architecture makes it easy to integrate with a real API:

   ```javascript
   async getAllBooks() {
     const response = await fetch('/api/books')
     return response.json()
   }
   ```

2. **Components don't need changes** - they already use the service layer

3. **Add loading and error states** - already implemented in components
